1. You've created a session id, how would you  handle this if events need to be resessionised, eg two batches of events appear to be separate, a new event (late arriving) appears that now joins them into one session what would the session id become?

2. Your session id appears scans all data, how would you optimise this for incremental loading

3. Your landing pages doesn't actually return the landing page, it is based on filters. How else might you work out the landing page of a session? (indexing)

4. You've filtered for COMPLETE bookings, what do you define as a conversion? If a booking completes and then cancels is that a conversion?

5. Your member age query, do you have any further notes/caveats around it? - the member age at time of event

6. How would you handle users that at one stage we don't know who they are and then at a later stage we learn who they are?
